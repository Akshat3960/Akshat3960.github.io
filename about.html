      <p>Hello! I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in AI and Data Science.
         Since my high-school time, I was very fascinated about different types of data and figuring out 
         about the trends and developments I can make out of them. I am proficient in Python and C++ programming langauges.
         I love to to automate large amounts of datasets using Python libraries such TensorFlow, Seaborn,numpy and matplotlib.
         I open to exploring and researching more in the field of AI and ML and making good products out of them which can benefit the society in an effective way.
